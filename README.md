For the graders:
    The code is in the src folder, and the main class is PageHandler.java.
    This project uses a MySQL database to store info, so please use the Backup.sql to create the database locally on your machine,
    and also please be sure to change the 'password' string in the MySQLHandler.java to match your MySQL root password.
    Finally, if you don't have the MySQL connector already installed,
    please be sure to include the MySQL connector library/jar file in your project or user libraries when running the code, 
    otherwise there may be issues when connecting to the database which may prevent full functionality.
    Also, this project uses Oracle OpenJDK 22.0.2, and javafx-sdk-22.0.2.
